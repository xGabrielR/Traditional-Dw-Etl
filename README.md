Simple ETL Tool for extract data from MySQL and PostgreSQL and storange on SQL Server. This example I have used Olist Kaggle Dataset and make a simple star schema model.

The inspiration for this repository was native data integration tools like Talend and Pentaho.
With them we can easily do a lot of things without having to write a lot of code, so the idea was to try to do something similar writing in Python.
